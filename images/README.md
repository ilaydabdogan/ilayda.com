# Profile Photos Setup

To complete the dual-photo glitch effect, add these two images:

## 1. Corporate Photo (`corporate-photo.jpg`)
- Professional headshot
- Business attire
- Polished, corporate look
- Recommended: Square aspect ratio, at least 400x400px

## 2. Childhood Photo (`childhood-photo.jpg`)
- Your authentic childhood self
- The photo will be enhanced with:
  - Neon green glow effect
  - High contrast
  - Slight sepia/corrupted look
  - Evil/mysterious aura
- Recommended: Square aspect ratio, at least 400x400px

## How the Effect Works
1. Site loads with corporate photo
2. After 5 seconds, the photo glitches dramatically
3. Corporate mask dissolves revealing childhood photo
4. Childhood photo appears with neon green glow and corrupted effects
5. The "true self" is revealed with pulsing evil aura

Place both images in this `/images/` directory.
