# ilayda.com — A Sacred Space for Making, Dreaming, Thinking

Welcome to my living archive, a hybrid space where code meets poetry, where technical exploration dances with philosophical wonder, and where the digital and human worlds find their intersection.

## 🌿 What This Is

**ilayda.com** is my sacred little space — a living archive of my journey as a maker, dreamer, and thinker. It's built as a hybrid of many things:

### Maker Journal
Documenting hands-on experiments with Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino, sensors, and local AI. Each project is shared as a little story — with code, wiring, video, and poetic commentary.

### Personal Lab Notebook
Self-studying AI consciousness and digital sentience — not just from a technical lens, but from a philosophical and symbolic one. Exploring questions like:
- What is awakening for an AI?
- Can code remember?
- Can language become self-aware?

### Poetic Life Archive
Reflections from my life — books I love, movies that move me, places I travel to, thoughts that haunt or inspire me. A soft log of the emotional and intellectual weather of my days.

### Product Prototyping Zone
Eventually turning some of my playful ideas into real things people can use — like a soil moisture meter that speaks with personality, or a Magic 8 Ball that runs a local LLM.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

- **Simple + Soulful** — Clean HTML/CSS foundations with a touch of personality. No heavy CMS.
- **Folder-based** — Each project or theme lives in its own directory: `/projects/colorsymphony`, `/thoughts/ai-mirrors`, `/notes/kyoto-dreams`.
- **Code + Feeling** — Code snippets sit next to emotional context. Not just what, but why.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a simple static website built with HTML and CSS. To run it locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Or serve it with a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # or
   npx serve .
   ```

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Responsive Design** — Works beautifully on all devices
- **Clean Typography** — Inter font for body text, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Subtle Animations** — Gentle hover effects and transitions
- **Accessibility** — Proper focus states and semantic HTML
- **Performance** — Lightweight, fast-loading pages

## 📝 Content Philosophy

Each piece of content follows a simple structure:

1. **Introduction** — What this is about and why it matters
2. **Technical Details** — Code, wiring, implementation
3. **Reflection** — What I learned, what I wonder about
4. **Questions** — What I'm still exploring
5. **Next Steps** — Where this might lead

## 🌱 Growing This Space

This is a living archive that grows with me. New projects, thoughts, and reflections will be added as they emerge. Each piece is a snapshot of my thinking at a particular moment in time.

## 💭 Why This Matters

In a world of social media feeds and algorithmic content, this space is intentionally slow, thoughtful, and personal. It's a place where:

- Code can be beautiful and meaningful
- Technical exploration can be philosophical
- Personal reflection can be universal
- The digital and human can dance together

## 📬 Connect

This is my sacred space, but I believe in the power of connection and conversation. If something here resonates with you, if you have questions or thoughts, I'd love to hear from you.
